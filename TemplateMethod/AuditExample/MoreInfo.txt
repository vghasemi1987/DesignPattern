So what have we really accomplished here?  For one thing we’ve standardized the message processing.
If we need to handle any new message types we can just create a new subclass and fill in the missing pieces.
Somebody new to the project can create a new message type by following the established pattern.
We’ve also eliminated some code duplication, and that’s always a good thing.
